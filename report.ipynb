    "Stocks (or shares) represent ownership in a company. Investors buy stocks to gain a portion of a company's profits, or to benefit from an increase in the stock's market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What are tickers?**\n",
    "A ticker is a unique symbol assigned to a company's stock, essentially an identifier for each company, in order to facilitate stock tracking:\n",

    " - `AAPL`: Apple Inc.\n",
    " - `GOOG`: Alphabet Inc. (or, simply put, Google)\n",
    " \n",
    "### **What are opening and closing prices?**\n",
    "The opening price is the price at which a stock begins trading, when the market opens for the day. \n",
    "The closing price is the actual last transaction price on that day, for that specific stock.\n",

    "### **What are windows, and how are they helpful during prediction?**\n",
    "In time series analysis, a \"window\" refers to a segment of the data used for analysis or prediction. \n",
    "By using time series analysis, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal effects in the data.\n",

    "### **Most importantly, how can I gain or lose money by investing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive return indicates profit, while a negative return signifies a loss. \n",

    " - Stock price increases from 100 to 110 -> the return is 10% -> <span style=\"color:green\">Profit!</span>\n",
