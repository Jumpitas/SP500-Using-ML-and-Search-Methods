    "Stocks (or shares) represent ownership in a company. Investors buy stocks to gain a portion of a company's profits, or to benefit from an increase in the stock's market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What are tickers?**\n",
    "A ticker is a unique symbol assigned to a company's stock, essentially an identifier for each company, in order to facilitate stock tracking:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `AAPL`: Apple Inc.\n",
    " - `GOOG`: Alphabet Inc. (or, simply put, Google)\n",
    " \n",
    "### **What are opening and closing prices?**\n",
    "The opening price is the price at which a stock begins trading, when the market opens for the day. \n",
    "The closing price is the actual last transaction price on that day, for that specific stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using daily windows in order to predict these prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are windows, and how are they helpful during prediction?**\n",
    "In time series analysis, a \"window\" refers to a segment of the data used for analysis or prediction. \n",
    "By using time series analysis, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal effects in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Most importantly, how can I gain or lose money by investing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive return indicates profit, while a negative return signifies a loss. \n",
    "These are typically expressed as a percentage of the original investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the investor purchases stock at 100:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Stock price increases from 100 to 110 -> the return is 10% -> <span style=\"color:green\">Profit!</span>\n",
    "\n",
    " - Stock price decreases from 100 to 90 -> the return is -10% -> <span style=\"color:red\">Loss!</span>\n",
